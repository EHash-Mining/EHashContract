**Ethereum Mining is a resilent and robust method for obtaining ETH. The emergence of EHash has provided the market with a new vehicle to participate in Ethereum mining with ease. ETH mining reward is allocated to EHash holders by smart contract deployed on Ethereum mainnet. EHash holders could enjoy a worry-free mining experience.**

Ethereum Mining is the process of mining Ether. Simply put, mining Ether equals securing the network which in turn ensures verified computation. Mining is a computationally intensive work that requires a lot of processing power and time. Mining is the act of participating in a given peer distributed cryptocurrency network in consensus. The miner is subsequently rewarded for providing solutions to challenging math problems. It is done by putting the computer’s hardware to use with mining applications. 

A miner is an investor that devotes time, computer space and energy to sorting through blocks. When the mining process hits the right harsh, they will submit their solutions to the issuer. After verification, the issuer of the currency offers rewards which are portions of the transactions they helped in verifying. They also offer digital coins in exchange for the work of miners. The result of digital mining is called proof of work system. 

**What’s the benefits of being a miner? And the disadvantages?**

* Benefits: Mining is not some cryptocurrency speculating activity that will get you rich over one night, rather, it’s a stable and resilient way to accumulate wealth gradually throughout time. Good thing about mining is that you can choose a convenient profitable pool and you can rest assured that it will regularly fill your virtual pockets with Ether.

* Disadvantages: First, mining is an arms race. ASIC equipment manufacturers are investing more and more money in order to create the most efficient hardware possible. Your equipment might be obsoleted by more advanced mining machines. Second, finding cheap and stable electricity supply is a challenge for ordinary people, especially individuals who want to get in this industry but do not have enough capital to start a mining business. The cryptocurrency market is evolving so fast that it’s a huge cost of time for newbies to compete in the mining industry. Third, there’re many frauds and cheats in the mining industry. Individuals doesn’t have the capacity to do due diligence. In this sense, cryptocurrency mining has no difference with gold mining, as they’re essentially embeded with the same business risk. 

**How is “HashAge Ethereum Hash Power” going to make a change?**

By offering the “Ethereum Hashing Power” token **EHash**, Ethereum mining has never become so easy and convenient for miners:

* EHash is the token that represents the mining power on Ethereum network. 1 EHash is strictly tethered to 0.01Mhash/s power. 

* EHash holders are free from head-scratching equipment maintenance issue. Even if there is any equipment malfunction and repair, the mining power is guaranteed by the provider.   

* EHash total outstanding supply is transparent and checkable on Ethereum network. And the actual mining power that supports EHash is also transparent and checkable on Mining Pool. For example, you can check it on F2Pool, one of the largest Ethereum mining pools in the world.  

* The mining output of Ethereum is allocated by smart contract to EHash holders automaticlly. Miners don’t have to do their own mining configurations like in traditional mining.  

* EHash is tradable on both CEX and DEX. In traditional mining industry, if you want to exit, you have to find a buyer, negotiate a price, and deliver your equipment to him to complete the sale. However, with EHash, you can simply trade it on exchanges to exit your position.
